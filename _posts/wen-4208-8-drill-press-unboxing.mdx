### Five Uses of a Drill Press

##### **1\. Cutting Mortises**

You have a couple of options when your cutting a mortise: A mortising machine, which is expensive; a plunge router, which can be unruly for this purpose; or a drill press.  If your on a limited budget a drill press is a great option.

##### **2\. Consistent Repeatable Cuts**

Whether you are cutting holes for dowels or quickly pre-drilling a project a drill press enables you to produce holes that are at perfect 90 degree angles at a consistent depth.  Try installing dowels with just a hand drill and you'll quickly realize not only how difficult a perfect 90 degree angle is - but also how frustrating being off by 1 degree can be.

##### **3\. DIY Drum Sander**

One of the more interesting uses is converting your drill press into a makeshift drum sander.  Pick up something like [Peachtree's 3" x 6" sanding drum](https://amzn.to/2q7DIkx) and all of the sudden your drill press is a drill pres*sander*.

##### **4\. Cutting Large Holes**

If you need a 6 inch hole in a project, your options for getting it done are limited.  Perhaps, you could use a jigsaw but no matter how steady handed you are your circle is not going to be perfect.  I drill press + a [$15 hole cutter attachment](https://amzn.to/2qZvNXC) makes cutting a perfect 6" hole quick and easy.

##### **5\. Accurate Angled Holes**

While most projects don't call for an angled hole of any kind, when you need to cut them a drill press is a necessity.  Some presses come with an adjustable table, but for those that don't [creating an angle jig ](http://www.woodworkersjournal.com/adjustable-angle-drilling-jig/)for a drill press is a simple enough task.
